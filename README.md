# Advanced Network Security Projects
This repository contains a series of projects relative to network security (attack and mitigation).
I developed a set of active defence mechanisms to protect a system on different layers.  
The project's complexity grows with the increase of their numbering, hence the project #6 is more intricate than #1.

All the codes developed were written in C++ and/or Python on a Linux OS.  
Every projects folder contains the following files:
- Description document which defines the guidelines/deliverables and in some cases input and example of output files.
- The project source code

## Topics
- Project 1: DNS packet capture and fields parsing (byte level malicious detection)
- Project 2: Dynamic ARP Inspection Module
- Project 3: ARP-request reply attack defence (WEP)
- Project 4: DDoS mitigation (iptables - bloom filters - longest prefix match trie)
- Project 5: Traffic fingerprinting of TLS flows (Markov chains)
- Project 6: IPS for SYN flood mitigations (Statical/Behavioral/Cookies protections)
